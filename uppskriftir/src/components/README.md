DEPRECATED AND/OR ABANDONED PAGES:

    uppskrift_numer.tsx = deprecated. only exists to show API error

    uppskr_flokk2.tsx = trying to make a second version of uppskr_flokkur.tsx, used some parts of _flokk2 in _flokkur to make it work. that page is deprecated.

    index > App > layout > uppskriftir > rest of the pages (randomjoke.tsx is inside layout)

    in other words: first page you see is heim.tsx, then you choose page on top in nav, between Heim (heim.tsx, go back home), Máltíðir (uppskriftir.tsx), Leita að máltíð (search for meal(uppskr_finna.tsx)), and Um Vesen (about the restaurant(about.tsx)).
    Footer has a dead link, that directs to a 404 page (notfound.tsx).
    Inside Máltíðir (uppskriftir.tsx) you can choose to search for a meal by: Staf (letter, uppskr_stafur.tsx), Flokki (category, uppskr_flokkur.tsx), and Einkennisnúmeri (ID, uppskrift_numer.tsx)(abandoned since I don't need to search by ID, it leads to a 404 error, unless you access it through Flokki (by category), then it shows an API error).
    Clicking on a meal takes you to card.tsx, which show a meal in detail.

*IMAGES*
    NONE of the images were AI generated. The frame around the joke and the cook at heim.tsx (also in about.tsx, and as the favicon) where hand drawn in Krita, by me. The gifs at the 404 page were yoinked from the Tenor gif site. The meal images are part of themealdb API.

    Gerði óvart 2 af viðbótarkröfunum, hélt á tímabili að search væri partur af lágmarkskröfum :o

    "þeta er han kali kokur" - in 4th grade we had a spelling test, and one of the sentences was "Þetta er hann Kalli kokkur". One of the kids made an epic spelling error.
